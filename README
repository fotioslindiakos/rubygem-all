Directions saved here for posterity:

I am assuming you have the necessary build tools installed (if not, yum install rpmdevtools) and have already created an RPM build environment, eg:

~/rpmbuild
|-- BUILD
|-- RPMS
|-- SOURCES
|-- SPECS
`-- SRPMS

First, make sure gem2rpm is installed:

yum install rubygem-gem2rpm

Then, grab the gem you want to convert to an RPM:

cd ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
gem fetch capistrano

This will dump the gem file in the current directory, in this case: capistrano-2.5.14.gem.

Next, create a spec file:

gem2rpm capistrano-2.5.14.gem  > ../SPECS/rubygem-capistrano.spec

Finally, build the RPM(s):

rpmbuild -ba ../SPECS/rubygem-capistrano.spec
